    <h1>Sunday Chili</h1>
    <img src="../img/Chili.jpg" alt="Bowl of chili" width="550" height="550">
    <h4>A Lazy Sunday Meal</h4>
    <p>It’s thick and appropriately chunky, spicy and extremely flavorful without being hot, balanced just right between meat, beans, and vegetables, and excellently scoopable (what else is chili for, really).</p>
    <p>And not to mention it does that chili magic thing where it gets better at leftovers.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons<strong>salt</strong></li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds<strong> ground beef</strong></li>
    <li>6 slices<strong> bacon,</strong> cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>half of an<strong> onion,</strong> diced</li>
    <li>4 cloves <strong>garlic,</strong> minced</li>
    <li>1 <strong>jalapeno,</strong> minced</li>
    <li>4 <strong>carrots,</strong> minced (optional)</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons<strong> chili powder</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons<strong>cumin</strong></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon<strong>oregano</strong></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon<strong>garlic powder</strong></li>
    <li>3–4 tablespoons<strong>tomato paste</strong></li>
    <li>1 28–ounce can fire roasted <strong>crushed tomatoes</strong></li>
    <li>2 14–ounce cans<strong> beans,</strong>rinsed and drained (I like black beans and pinto beans)</li>
    <li>2 cups beef or<strong> chicken broth</strong>(plus more to thin as needed)</li>
    <li>toppings: avocado, cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, red onion, cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix salt with ground beef. Set aside so it can get nice and salty while you prep the other ingredients. In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, fry your bacon pieces until crispy. Drain on paper towel lined plates. Pour off most of the bacon fat, but leave 1-2 tablespoons for sautéing.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno, and carrots. Sauté until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and spices. Brown until fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste. Sauté for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, beans, broth, and bacon. Bring to a low simmer. Cover it and let it hang out over low heat for at least 30-45 minutes, but ideally 2+ hours (this helps the flavors develop and this is why it’s Sunday chili).You can alternate between  keeping it over a low flame and just letting it rest in the hot pot. It will thicken, so use extra water or broth to thin it out to desired consistency.</li>
        <li>BOOM! Top with all your favorite toppings. Make plans to revisit this again next Sunday.</li>
    </ol>
