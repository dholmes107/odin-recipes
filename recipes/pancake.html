    <h4>What are pancakes but delicious?</h4>
    <p>You can fancify pancakes all you want, but can you really ever deny a butter-soaked blueberry pancake laced with maple syrup and dripping with hot, bursty blue juices?</p>
    <p>If you can, you are probably not human.</p>
    <br>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup<strong> milk</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons<strong>white vinegar</strong></li>
    <li>1 cup<strong> flour</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons<strong> sugar</strong></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon <strong> baking powder</strong></li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
    <li>1 <strong>egg</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons <strong>melted butter</strong></li>
    <li>1+ cup fresh <strong>blueberries</strong></li>
    <li>more <strong> butter</strong>for the pan</li>
</ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you’re making “buttermilk” here).</li>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like to eat these plain. YUM, YUM, YUM.</li>
    </ol>
