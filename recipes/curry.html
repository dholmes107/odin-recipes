    <h4>What Red Curry Is To Me</h4>
    <!-- Recipe Data Taken From: https://pinchofyum.com/red-curry-lentils Project Is For Fun Not Distribution -->
<p>These red curry lentils are one of my all-time favorite recipes. As is usually my vibe, we’re working with very basic pantry ingredients here and simple, straightforward prep. It’s hard to mess this one up.
Just cook your lentils and toss them in up this spicy red curry sauce with sauteed onions and a shot of coconut milk.<em> OH MY PERFECTLY SPICY GOODNESS.</em></p>
<p>I’ve kind of had a fling with lentils lately. Or wait, like, over the last 8 years. I can barely stand it. If you’ve never made lentils before, this is a perfect recipe to introduce you to the magic of the most cheap, healthy, versatile, and absolutely delicious little food in the pantry. The Humble Lentil reigns supreme.</p>
<p>Will you eat a big plate of these red curry lentils with rice? Or will you scoop up a creamy bite with a warm piece of naan? Or will you eat it cold out of the fridge with exactly zero judgement from me?</p>
<p>Only Time Will Tell.</p>
